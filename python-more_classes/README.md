# Python - Object-Oriented Programming

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python. By the end of the project, students will be equipped with the ability to explain and implement key OOP concepts and Python-specific features without relying on external resources.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain the following concepts clearly and confidently:

### General Python and OOP Concepts
- Why Python programming is awesome
- What Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is
- The concept of “first-class everything” in Python
- What a class is
- What an object and an instance are
- The difference between a class and an object/instance

### Attributes and Methods
- What an attribute is
- The difference between public, protected, and private attributes
- The meaning and role of `self`
- What a method is
- What a class method is
- What a static method is
- What a class attribute is vs an instance attribute

### Special Methods and Properties
- The purpose of the `__init__` method and how to use it
- The difference between the `__str__` and `__repr__` methods
- How to use `__str__` and `__repr__` properly
- What a property is
- The difference between an attribute and a property in Python
- The Pythonic way to write getters and setters

### Data Management and Reflection
- What `__dict__` is and what it contains for a class or instance
- How Python finds attributes of an object or class
- How to use the `getattr()` function
- How to dynamically create arbitrary new attributes for existing instances
- How to bind attributes to objects and classes

### Abstraction and Encapsulation
- The concepts of data abstraction, data encapsulation, and information hiding

## Usage

This project is implemented using Python 3 and adheres to best practices in OOP, documentation, and Pythonic design. Each file and class is documented with docstrings and includes examples or tests demonstrating expected behavior.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8.5+
- No external libraries required
- Compliant with PEP8 and pycodestyle
