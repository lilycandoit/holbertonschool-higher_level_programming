# Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

## Description

This project covers the fundamentals of Python data structures with a focus on **lists** and **tuples**. It introduces their creation, manipulation, and usage in various contexts such as stacks, queues, comprehensions, and sequence operations. By the end of the project, youâ€™ll be able to confidently work with these core data types and understand their behaviors and differences.
