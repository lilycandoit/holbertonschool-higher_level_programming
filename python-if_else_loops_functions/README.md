# Python - if/else, loops, functions

## Description

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum and introduces fundamental control flow concepts in Python. By the end of the project, students are expected to understand and apply conditional statements, loops, functions, and proper Python syntax, all without external help (i.e., Google). Code quality and adherence to style guidelines are emphasized.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, I am able to explain and apply the following:

- The importance of indentation in Python
- How to use `if`, `if ... else`, and `if ... elif ... else` statements
- How to write and use comments
- How to assign and manipulate variable values
- How to use `while` and `for` loops effectively
- The purpose of `break` and `continue` statements
- The use of `else` clauses with loops
- The function and timing of the `pass` statement
- How to use `range()` for iterations
- What functions are and how to define and call them
- Behavior of functions without `return` statements
- Variable scope (local vs. global)
- Understanding and interpreting a traceback
- The role of arithmetic operators and how to use them

## Requirements

- Code editors allowed: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- Python version: Python 3.8.* (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS)
- All files must end with a new line
- The first line of each script must be: `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- All scripts must be executable
- PEP 8 compliance (checked with `pycodestyle` 2.7.*)
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project is mandatory
- File length will be checked using `wc`

## Usage

To execute any script from this project in your terminal:

```bash
./filename.py
```

Make sure the file if executable:
```bash
chmod +x filename.py
```
or for all python files:

```bash
chmod +x *.py
```
